Specifies the pattern of dashes and gaps used to stroke paths. The
   strokeDashArray represents an array of numbers that specify the lengths of
   alternating dashes and gaps in pixels. If an odd number of values is
   provided, then the list of values is repeated to yield an even number of
   values. To remove an existing dash array, pass a null strokeDashArray.
   A typical strokeDashArray might contain the members 5 3 2.
